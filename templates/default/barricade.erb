#
# Barricade Network and Application Monitoring configuration file.
#
# Lines that beging with a # are comment lines and are ignored by the
# network monitor. Any command line option overrides these configurations.
#
# Parameter: license_key
# Value:     A 40-character hexadecimal string provided by Barricade.io. This
#            parameter is required for all transactions and in order for the
#            security monitor to start.
#
license_key=<%= @barricade_key %>

#
# Parameter: tag
# Value:     An arbitrary scalar value that will be used by you and your
#            team to effectively "tag" results sent to the Barricade platform.
#
#            This can be used to tag "development, staging, production" environments,
#            "commit" versions, it could be dates, etc.
# Default:   production
# Docs:      https://docs.barricade.io/using-barricade/#tagging-filtering
# tag=production
<% unless @tags.empty? -%>
tag=<%= @tags %>
<% end %>

#
# Parameter: filter
# Value:     The default network filter which is compatible with libpcap's
#            format (i.e. "port not 53 and port not 22" to stop listening for
#            DNS and SSH requests.
# Warning:   Stopping the collection of services means that attacks on said services
#            will not be detected.
#
#
# filter=port not 22
<% unless @filter.empty? -%>
filter=<%= @filter %>
<% end %>

#
# Parameter: collector_host
# Value:     The domain name of the Barricade collector hostname to connect to. Changing
#            this value, unless advised by a member of Barricade is likely to result in a
#            loss of data if the hostname is not properly configured.
# Default:   collector.barricade.io
#
# collector_host=collector.barricade.io

#
# Parameter: collector_port
# Value:     The port to use on the collector. Should you wish to play with a mock
#            server to see what's going to the Barricade services, you can develop
#            a simple webserver and specify the port here.
# Default:   80
# collector_port=80
#
# Or if you are using 0mq:
#
# Collector port:
# collector_port=443

#
# Parameter: loglevel
# Value:     The level of logging information about the agent to store.
#            The possible values are broken down as follow:
#                error        -> Show errors only
#                warning      -> Show errors and warnings
#                info         -> Show additional information messages
#                verbose      -> Show detailed information messages
#                debug        -> Show agent-debug messages
#                verbosedebug -> Show very detailed agent-level debug messages
# Default:   error
#
# loglevel=error
<% unless @loglevel.empty? -%>
loglevel=<%= @loglevel %>
<% end %>

#
# Parameter: ssl
# Value:     This indicates whether or not we want to attempt to
#            to decrypt the SSl encrypted data before sending it
#            to the collector.
# Default:   false
# Note:      This is useful if you are interested in further preventing
#            attacks that happen over HTTPs (https://...)
#
# ssl=yes

#
# Parameter: ssl_ca_bundle
# Value:     This contains the name of the PEM-encoded certificate-authority (CA)
#            bundle to use for SSL connection protection. The agent will attempt
#            to find the SSL certificate on its own by looking into the most common
#            location where one usually finds it.
# Default:   /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
#
# ssl_ca_bundle=/etc/barricade/collector.crt

#
# Parameter: ssl_ca_path
# Value:    If your SSL configuration does not use CA bundles but has a directory
#           containing multiple PEM-encoded Certificate Authority files, configure
#           this option to point to the directory with the CA files.
# Default:  /etc/ssl/certs
#
#ssl_ca_path=/etc/ssl/certs

#
# Parameter: flush_frequency
# Value:     How often (in seconds) events should be send to the collector.
#            Events are batched together to make the traffic output more uniformly
#            distributed for varying ingress. The more frequently data is flushed,
#            the more up to date a picture of your network Barricade has.
# Default:   1
# flush_frequency=1
<% unless @flush_frequency.empty? -%>
flush_frequency=<%= @flush_frequency %>
<% end %>

#
# Parameter: concurrency
# Value:     The number of worker processes to spawn for sending data to the collector.
#            This should be tuned with the `flush_frequency` option as each worker will
#            update concurrently. So a concurrency of 10 and a flush_frequency of 1 will
#            mean 10 updates per second in total to the collector.
# Default:   1
#
# concurrency=1
<% unless @concurrency.empty? -%>
concurrency=<%= @concurrency %>
<% end %>

#
# Parameter: id_path
# Value:     The path to the server id file. This contains a unique identifier for the agent on
#            a particular server. Normally, this is autogenerated.
# Default:   /etc/barricade/id
#
# id_path=/etc/barricade/id

#
# Parameter: high_water_mark
# Value:     Maximum number of events to queue before dropping events.
#            This is to prevent inundating your server with requests to Barricade under unusual traffic conditions.
#            The default is tuned very high so as not to drop events most of the time, but you may need to change this
#            depending on your traffic profile.
#            If the logs contain warnings about the "high_water_mark" being passed, you may need to adjust this setting,
#            or investigate if this seems like unusually high traffic.
#
# Default:   10000
#
# high_water_mark=10000
<% unless @high_water_mark.empty? -%>
high_water_mark=<%= @high_water_mark %>
